Social networks have been found to impact an individual's outcomes and their behaviours. This has been studied in several different disciplines and across various different social groups, including legislators, with research finding that connected legislators are more effective and that personal connections impact their voting behaviour. My paper will use data from Early Day Motions to conduct a social network analysis of MPs. I will analyse how the social networks of MPs are impacted by elections and how this impacts their position within their party.
